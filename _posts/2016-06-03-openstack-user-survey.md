### What's OpenStack User Survey

> A snapshot of OpenStack users’ attitudes and deployments.

### Takeaway

* Use Net Promoter Scores (NPS) to generate an accurate comparison. **What's NPS
, btw?**
* The most dominant category in the user survey remains information technology
**(68%)**.
* Most industries have more than half of respondents running OpenStack in
production, which is consistent with the overall 65% of deployments recorded in
this survey at a production stage.
* Community members were asked to select their top reasons for choosing
OpenStack and rank these in terms of priority. The vast majority **(66%)** still
focus first on cost, just one point off last cycle’s response.
* Why do users recommend OpenStack and why don’t they? On the positive side,
community support, avoiding vendor lock-in, consistency, stability, and the
importance of open source were key drivers. On the negative side, complexity,
difficulty in deployment, inconsistency, and lack of stability were cited.
* Which workloads and frameworks are running on OpenStack? Software development
and testing remains the top use case.
* What container and PaaS tools are used to manage OpenStack applications?
Kubernetes **(42%)** surged ahead of CloudFoundry **(24%)** in this cycle,
increasing 8 points to be the top Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) tool, while
CloudFoundry lost 11 points.
